## Build
### Modules
| Module             | Packaging      | Description   |
| -------------      | ------------- | ------------- |
| parent             | pom | Global build properties for all modules |
| nusic-apk          | apk | Assembly maven module containing the guice module, wires up all dependencies and builds the APK |
| nusic-ui-android   | aar | Contains all android specific frontend-code |
| nusic-core-api     | jar | Interfaces of the central logic module |
| nusic-core-android | jar | Android-specific implementation of the central logic module |
| nusic-data-api     | jar | Interfaces of the persistence module |
| nusic-data-android | jar | Android-specific implementation of the persistence module |
| nusic-domain       | jar | Domain objects for persistence and migration between the layers |
| nusic-util         | jar | Utility module, containing logic common to all modules |

### Maven
In order to build the APK use the [SDK manager](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/sdk-manager.html) to download the SDK Version specified in the [parent POM's properties](https://github.com/schnatterer/nusic/blob/develop/pom.xml) and deploy android to your local maven repo using [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer). Also make sure to set your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to `sdk` folder of your Android SDK.
Then just run
    mvn install
Or if you want to deploy to your devices (vie ADB):
    mvn install android:deploy android:run
    
Note: During the build, the APK is signed using a keystore. In order not to hard-code any credentials, it uses variables.
You could pass those via the command line or define them in your ~/.m2/settings.xml like so:
```xml
<profile>
 <id>keystore</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <properties>
        <sign.keystore>FULL/path/to/keystore</sign.keystore>
        <sign.alias>the key's alias within the keystore</sign.alias>
        <sign.keypass>password for keystore</sign.keypass>
        <sign.storepass>password for key</sign.storepass>
    </properties>
</profile>
```

### Eclipse
* When using [m2eclipse](http://eclipse.org/m2e/) and [m2e-android](http://rgladwell.github.io/m2e-android/) and have your local maven repo set up (see above), maven and m2e should set you up with all you need to build an run right away.
* For setting up android libs, add nuisc-ui-android as library to nusic-apk and android-support-v7-appcompat from ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/support/v7/appcompat.
* In order to be able to use RoboBlender properly, add a source folder that points to `target/generated-sources/annotations` to each android-module (nusic-data-android, nusic-core-android, nusic-ui-android). Not doing this will most likely result in a `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: AnnotationDatabaseImpl` when starting the app.
* For running robolectric tests from eclipse, you need to add the robolectric libraries (robolectric*.jar and android_all*.jar) to the modules (e.g. nusic-data-android). Those have been removed from the maven build of m2e because m2e doesn't know about scopes and and adding android_all*.jar to the APK will dramatically slow down the eclipse build or even fail it (exceed the 65K limit).
