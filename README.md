## Build
### Modules
| Module             | Packaging      | Description   |
| -------------      | ------------- | ------------- |
| parent             | pom | Global build properties for all modules |
| nusic-apk          | apk | Assembly maven module containing the guice module, wires up all dependencies and builds the APK |
| nusic-ui-android   | aar | Contains all android specific frontend-code |
| nusic-core-api     | jar | Interfaces of the central logic module |
| nusic-core-android | jar | Android-specific implementation of the central logic module |
| nusic-data-api     | jar | Interfaces of the persistence module |
| nusic-data-android | jar | Android-specific implementation of the persistence module |
| nusic-domain       | jar | Domain objects for persistence and migration between the layers |
| nusic-util         | jar | Utility module, containing logic common to all modules |

### Maven
In order to build the APK use the [SDK manager](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/sdk-manager.html) to download the SDK Version specified in the [POM](https://github.com/schnatterer/nusic/blob/master/Nusic/pom.xml) and deploy android and the the support API to your local maven repo using [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployerjust).
Then just run
    mvn install
Or if you want to deploy to your devices (vie ADB):
    mvn install android:deploy android:run
    
Note: During the build, the APK is signed using a keystore. In order not to hard-code any credentials, it uses variables.
You could pass those via the command line or define them in your ~/.m2/settings.xml like so:
```xml
<profile>
 <id>keystore</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <properties>
        <sign.keystore>FULL/path/to/keystore</sign.keystore>
        <sign.alias>the key's alias within the keystore</sign.alias>
        <sign.keypass>password for keystore</sign.keypass>
        <sign.storepass>password for key</sign.storepass>
    </properties>
</profile>
```

#### Release
Because of the dependency to the source code of musicbrainz (whose version number we don't want transformed by maven release plugin) we need to exclude this submodule. A normal release will just release the current snapshot version, so we don't need interactive mode for this:  
`mvn release:prepare release:perform -pl info.schnatterer.nusic:nusic-parent,info.schnatterer.nusic:nusic-app --batch-mode`

### Eclipse
When using [m2eclipse](http://eclipse.org/m2e/) and [m2e-android](http://rgladwell.github.io/m2e-android/) and have your local maven repo set up (see above), maven and m2e should set you up with all you need to build an run right away.
